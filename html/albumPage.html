Like a well-written novel having introduction, development, twists, and conclusion it shared a compelling story for two and a half years.</p>

                        <p>BTS’ LOVE YOURSELF series bears the message that loving oneself is the beginning of true love. Whereas the previously unveiled LOVE YOURSELF 起 ‘WONDER’ and LOVE YOURSELF 承 ‘HER’ albums expressed the heart-fluttering and tingling moments of love, LOVE YOURSELF 轉 ‘TEAR’ album embodies the pain of boys faced with parting.</p>

                        <p>“MAP OF THE SOUL : 7” looks back on the past seven years of BTS since their debut as seven members of one team. The journey was not always smooth sailing, and there were special travails that they had to endure in their rise as global superstars. Now, understanding that the scars left by those hardships is a part of their real selves, BTS accepts both “the self I want to show” and the “self I want to scorn” to at last tell their own story of finding their “real and complete selves”.</p>

                        <p>As a sense of helplessness looms in every corner of the world, BTS opens themselves up to express their mixed feelings about this situation—fear and anxiety mingled with the determination to overcome all this. The album consists of a total of eight tracks including the No.1 summer hit “Dynamite” and lead single “Life Goes On”. The latter speaks on behalf of everyone stuck in the new normality brought on by COVID-19: one day, the world stopped without any warning, streets erased of footsteps and the way out is nowhere near in sight. BTS echoes in a low voice the comforting message that in the face of unexpected turns “Life Goes On” and extends their hands towards the future.</p>

                        <p>LOVE YOURSELF 承 'HER' is an expression of the anxiety and elation of love, told in the unique style of BTS. The “love” that BTS aims to convey in the LOVE YOURSELF series is both the individual experience of a boy growing into adulthood and a message of peace and unity to our society today. In the mini album 承 'HER' that begins this new narrative, the image of boys in love for the first time are expressed in a refreshing and cheerful take that aims to talk about the topic of “love” while immersed in a coming-of-age tale.</p>

                        <p>BTS will release their second studio album, WINGS.
                            Having met their most beautiful moment in life through the ablum series of the same title, BTS now stands before a new door. Set for release on October 10, WINGS contains songs about boys who encounter temptation for the first time and must ponder and agonize in the face of it. As the seven boys experience pain and bliss, they bring forth the image of birds that break out of their shells and try to take flight for the first time.</p>

                        <p>Seven young men on the threshold of their 20s. Now entering their young adulthood, the members of BTS sang in their previous album, The most beautiful moment in life pt.1, about people their age being threatened by uncertainty. Released seven months after that first installment, The most beautiful moment in life pt.2 sings about the energy of youth barreling forward, embracing even the uncertainty and insecurity. Now beginning to taste the bitterness of grown-up life, they can easily sense that life isn't always beautiful. However, they continue to sprint forward, relying only on their two destitute legs and the fire in their hearts. There’s nothing else to do but keep running. Facing the powerlessness of one’s youth, they collide and shatter and still cry out that “it’s okay to fall, it’s okay to get hurt.” That is the beauty of this moment.</p>

                        <p>No longer just young boys, the album is an introduction to BTS as a group that continues to grow and develop. In each track are distilled poetic and pop emotions that allows the listener to sense both the soft and the resounding musical transformation of the group.
                            After successfully concluding the “School Trilogy” that discusses the main topics of interest for teens—dreams, happiness and love—the new album begins to discuss “youth”. BTS has chosen the theme of “the most beautiful moment in life”, the start of one’s young adulthood in which beauty coexists with uncertainty.</p>
